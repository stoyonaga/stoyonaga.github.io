        &lt;p&gt;Neurodivergent students have among the worst attrition and graduation rates in higher education institutions despite their strengths in strong memory, technological competency, and work ethic. Curriculum&apos;s are often designed for the, &quot;average learner&quot;, and faculty members are not trained to properly accommodate diverse and interconnected learning differences which leads to poor academic performance. Furthermore, existing transition supports are demonstrably inaccessible (e.g., understaffed, too expensive) and ineffective, often utilizing a broad one-size-fits-all approach such as offering extra time on assignments and tests.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This project aims to (1) understand the phenomenological experiences of neurodivergent students in academia, and (2) co-design, develop, and evaluate a multimodal transparent and trustworthy AI-empowered chatbot which aims to help neurodivergent students with executive functioning and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Executive functioning challenges include time management, organization, task initiation, and planning, while emotional regulation refers to managing anxiety, stress, and emotional responses to academic demands and sensory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By having access to this tool, students can effectively unmask and receive 24/7 supportive and non-judgmental mentorship, guidance, and support for organizing and managing their time.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Physical inactivity among the global population has warranted substantial concern in recent times. In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that approximately 28% of adults and 81% of children were living sedentary lifestyles which could lead to chronic obesity. A wealth of literature demonstrates that long-term obesity increases risk factors related to increased mortality via cardiovascular, pulmonary, and cognitive diseases / decline.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Existing interventions such as mobile apps and fitness centers have been shown to be ineffective due to a one-size fits-all approach and ad hoc design principles. Furthermore, there are barriers related to location, accessibility, and a high cost of entry.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My research proposes to use classical machine learning, generative artificial intelligence (LLMs), and explainability to build trust-worthy tools that can generate persuasive, tailored fitness plans in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a trend that has been seen in past health epidemics [11, 12]. Our work aims to study the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit through a Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph-based approach. We use NetworkX, Gephi, Streamlit, Plotly, and Large Language Models to build a comprehensive analytics and visualization system that that is capable of extracting core metrics identifying malicious users in the social network. Lastly, our results are consistent with previous work [1], however, we extend on what has been done by contributing a robust QA Dashboard system that is interactive and intuitive for users to learn about vaccine misinformation. This work can be valuable for many organizations that aim to address misinformation as it provides an actionable framework to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;EECS-Notes GitHub Repository&lt;/strong&gt; is a project that I started working on during the Winter 2023 semester. Originally, it was mostly used to share my programming solutions with the instructor of a fourth year cryptography course. Overtime, it has become a repository in which I share my midterm and/or exam review notes for challenging upper-year programming courses such as Operating Systems, Algorithms &amp;amp; Analysis, Database Systems, Human-Computer Interaction, and Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to share tutoring resources in order to facilitate growth in others. By doing so, and making such materials more accessible, it is my hope that students feeling overwhelmed by certain concepts can truly come to learn and enjoy the material. Lastly, it is my hope that by doing so, it inspires others to join an open-source movement in which they share their work with others to benefit the greatest amount of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Course Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a non-exhaustive list. To view a sample version of the notes, please visit the corresponding GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning &amp;amp; Pattern Recognition (GS/EECS 5327): &lt;/strong&gt;Machine learning is the study of algorithms that learn how to perform a task from prior experience. This course introduces the student to machine learning concepts and techniques applied to pattern recognition problems in a diversity of application areas. &lt;strong&gt;Sample notes can be obtained &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.overleaf.com/project/656694966fe5cad0eae543a6&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Originally, it was mostly used to share my programming solutions with the instructor of a fourth year cryptography course. Overtime, it has become a repository in which I share my midterm and/or exam review notes for challenging upper-year programming courses such as Operating Systems, Algorithms &amp;amp; Analysis, Database Systems, Human-Computer Interaction, and Machine Learning. Motivation I like to share tutoring resources in order to facilitate growth in others. By doing so, and making such materials more accessible, it is my hope that students feeling overwhelmed by certain concepts can truly come to learn and enjoy the material. Lastly, it is my hope that by doing so, it inspires others to join an open-source movement in which they share their work with others to benefit the greatest amount of people. Course Notes The following is a non-exhaustive list. To view a sample version of the notes, please visit the corresponding GitHub repository. Machine Learning &amp;amp; Pattern Recognition (GS/EECS 5327): Machine learning is the study of algorithms that learn how to perform a task from prior experience. This course introduces the student to machine learning concepts and techniques applied to pattern recognition problems in a diversity of application areas. Sample notes can be obtained here. Human-Computer Interaction (LE/EECS 4441): Introduces the concepts and technology necessary to design, manage and implement interactive software. Students work in small groups and learn how to design user interfaces, how to realize them and how to evaluate the end result. Both design and evaluation are emphasized. Sample notes can be obtained here. Operating System Fundamentals (LE/EECS 3221): Principles of operating systems. Concurrent processes, CPU scheduling, deadlocks, memory management, file systems, protection and security, and case studies. Sample notes can be obtained here. Mathematics of Cryptography (LE/EECS 4161): Probability, information theory and number theory and applications to cryptography. Classical codes such as Caesar shift, Vigenere, ADFGVX, rectangular substitution, and others.
