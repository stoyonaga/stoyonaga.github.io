<h1>Introduction </h1>
I am a Fourth-Generation Japanese-Canadian Computer Science Graduate (MSc, BA) from <a href = "https://lassonde.yorku.ca/">York University, Lassonde School of Engineering</a>. 

Having been born and raised in Toronto, one of the most multicultural cities in the world, this experience has allowed me to embrace the multiplicity of many different lifestyles and perspectives.

My unique combination of an arts (Hons BA) and science (MSc) background allows me to maneuver between interdisciplinary fields and create well-thought out and articulated rationales behind my innovations.

<h2>Research</h2>
My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Human-AI Interaction (HAI), and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in using Generative AI (e.g., Agents) to address a multiplicitly of problems such as information overload and personalization.

Currently, I am working on projects relating to:
<ul>
    <li>Mental Health: Anxiety Disorders</li>
    <li>Multi-Agent Systems</li>
    <li>Suicidal Ideation Classification</li>
    <li>Large Language Models (Finetuning)</li>
</ul>

In the past, I have worked on:
<ul>
    <li>Assistive Technologies for Postsecondary Neurodivergent Students</li>
    <li>Fitness-based Recommender Systems</li>
    <li>Explainable AI & Chronic Illnesses</li>
    <li>Genetic Algorithms and UI/UX Design</li>
    <li>Persuasive Design Frameworks</li>
    <li>Misinformation Tracking on Twitter & Reddit</li>
</ul>

Some of my past work has been done in collaboration with the <a href = "https://www.yorku.ca/yfile/2022/04/13/catalyzing-interdisciplinary-research-clusters-initiative-invites-new-applicants/">Catalyzing Interdisciplinary Research Clusters Initiative (Catalyst)</a> and <a href = "https://gamay-hub.github.io/">Graphics and Media at York Hub</a> groups.

<h2>Service</h2>
Throughout my time at York University, I have created publicly available course notes and volunteered as a Peer Helper to assist incoming students in acclimating to the new workload. 

Additionally, as a Graduate student, I have created tutorial videos under the GaMay Hub to help incoming researchers understand the process of completing PRISMA-based systematic reviews with tools for calculating Cohen Kappa scores and generating the Title, Abstract, Keyword excel sheets.

Lastly, I have had the privilege of mentoring students through tutoring undergraduate courses, managing course projects, and assisting in the writing and reviewing of manuscripts for publication.
