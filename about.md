<h2>References</h2>
<p>I take great pride in the work I do, whether it be done individually or in a team environment. I believe that multiple points of view are always welcome, and moreover, necessary to understanding problems. If you would like to see some testimonials written from my team members, or to obtain references, please contact me directly.</p>
