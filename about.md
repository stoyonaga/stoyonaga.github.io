<h1>Introduction </h1>
I am a Fourth-Generation Japanese-Canadian citizen studying Computer Science at York University under the supervision of <a href = "https://lassonde.yorku.ca/users/koyibo" target = "_blank">Dr. Kiemute Oyibo</a>. 

Having been born and raised in Toronto Ontario, one of the most multicultural cities in the world, this experience has allowed me to embrace the multiplicity of many different lifestyles and perspectives.

My unique combination of an arts background (Hons BA) and science (MSc) allows me to maneuver between interdisciplinary fields and create well-thought out and articulated rationales behind my innovations.

<h2>Research</h2>
Within the Persuasive Design Lab, my research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Human-AI Interaction (HAI), Persuasive Design, and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in using Generative AI (e.g., Agents) to address a multiplicitly of problems such as information overload and personalization.

Currently, I am working on projects relating to:
<ul>
    <li>Fitness-based Recommender Systems</li>
    <li>Assistive Technologies for Postsecondary Neurodivergent Students</li>
    <li>Explainable AI & Chronic Illnesses</li>
    <li>Suicidal Ideation Classification</li>
    <li>Mental Health: Anxiety Disorders</li>
</ul>

In the past, I have worked on:
<ul>
    <li>Genetic Algorithms and UI/UX Design</li>
    <li>Persuasive Design Frameworks</li>
    <li>Misinformation Tracking on Twitter & Reddit</li>
    <li>Large Language Models (Finetuning)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Service</h2>
Throughout my time at York University, I have created publicly available course notes and volunteered as a Peer Helper to assist incoming students in acclimating to the new workload. 

Additionally, as a Graduate student, I have created tutorial videos under the Persuasive Design Lab to help incoming researchers understand the process of completing PRISMA-based systematic reviews with tools for calculating Cohen Kappa scores and generating the Title, Abstract, Keyword excel sheets.

Lastly, I have had the privilege of mentoring students through tutoring undergraduate courses, managing course projects, and assisting in the writing and reviewing of manuscripts for publication.
