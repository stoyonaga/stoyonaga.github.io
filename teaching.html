<h2><u>LE/EECS 4443: Mobile User Interfaces</u></h2>
<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> The design and implementation of user interfaces for touchscreen devices and tablet computers. Students develop user interfaces that include touch, multi-touch, vibration, device motion, position, and orientation, environment sensing, video capture, and audio capture. Twelve Supervised laboratory hours that emphasize these topics in a practical manner.</p>

<h2><u>LE/EECS 1022: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming</u></h2>
<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Provides a first exposure to object-oriented programming and enhances student understanding of key computing skills such as programming with objects and simple data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists), reasoning about algorithms, and working with software tools. It uses a problem-based approach to expose the underlying concepts and an experiential laboratory to implement them. A mature Integrated Development Environment (such as Java and the Eclipse programming, testing, and debugging environment) is used to expose and provide context to the underlying ideas. Laboratory exercises expose students to a range of real-world problems with a view of motivating computational thinking and grounding the material covered in lectures.</p>
